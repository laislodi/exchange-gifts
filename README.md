# Excange Gifts in the Holidays

Exchange Gifts is a simple script in Python that allows you and your friends to exchange gifts. Nobody will ever be left out!

# How does it work?

It's simple: you just need to update the input with everyone's name and email. After that, just run the script! It will show you who's got whom.

It should show something like this:

```
Call Danny and after that, click any key.
```

After Danny, in this case, comes. He presses any key and this will show:

```
Danny (danny@mail.com) -> Chris (chris@mail.com)
Click any key to continue...
```

After Danny clicks any key again, this will show:

```
Call Alex and after that, click any key.
```

Between any two of these messages, lots of new lines are printed so we cannot see the previous message. As long as people don't scroll up, we can play a fair game.
