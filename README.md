# Excange Gifts in the Holidays

Exchange gifts is a simple script in Python that allows you and your friends to exchange gifts. Nobody will ever be left out!

# How does it work?

It's simple, you just need to update the input with everyone's name and email. After that, just run the script! It will show you who's got whom.

# Next steps...

I know the idea is that we exchange gifts without knowing the whole list... That's why is no fun to have everything just printed out in the screen.
The next step is to send everyone an email with just enough information as you need, that is: who you have to give your gift! That's right, no printing on the screen, 'cause that's boring (and it spoils all the fun)!
